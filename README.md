A minimal example dataset for illustrating the data format and training workflow of MCU-Net, provided for methodological understanding and reproducibility.

# MCU-Net Demo Dataset

This repository provides a minimal example dataset to illustrate the data format and training workflow of the MCU-Net framework proposed in the paper:

**Efficient Ink-Saving Lab-to-CMYK Color Mapping through Unsupervised Deep Learning with Physical Constraints**,  
published in *Multimedia Systems*.

## Purpose

The dataset is intended solely for:
- Demonstrating the structure and format of Lab, CMYK, and spectral data
- Facilitating understanding and validation of the proposed training pipeline
- Supporting methodological-level reproducibility

## Important Note

This dataset represents a **small illustrative dataset** collected using a laboratory research inkjet printer.
It is **not the full experimental dataset** used to produce the quantitative results reported in the paper.

As a result:
- The numerical results reported in the paper cannot be reproduced using this dataset alone
- The dataset should not be interpreted as a benchmark or a commercial printer profile
